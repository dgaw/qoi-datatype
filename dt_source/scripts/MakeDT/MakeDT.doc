                           *** 2. Introduction ***

	Workbench 3.0 introduced cool new feature: DataTypes. DataTypes
provide common ground for dealing with different types of data found on modern
computers. With DataTypes you don't have to worry about complexities of file
formats. For example, a paint program using DataTypes could load any type of
pictures: ILBM's, GIF's, JPEG's etc. and save in any of the formats supported.
Or you could load/save different formats of sound samples. The DataTypes can
deal with any kind of data.
	Another advantage of DataTypes is OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).
This technique is already used on PC's and Macs. It allows a program to
transfer control on an object to another program. With OLE you could import a
picture into your favourite wordprocessor and then just by clicking on it call
a paint program, which would automatically load this picture.
	And I should mention DataTypes' ability to recognize type of data:
even if they don't know what to do with a file, they can tell you what this
file contains. This is similar to features of some Public Domain programs:
WhatIs and CFX, for example. But DataTypes have an advantage of being
sanctioned by Commodore, which makes them available to everyone.
	Unfortunately, these capabilities still wait to be uncovered. Very few
programs actually use DataTypes. In fact, only Workbench programs and some
viewers take advantage of them. This is partially due to the fact, that there
is very little documentation about DataTypes.
	My goal is to change it. This program will let you create new
DataTypes (well, only part of them) easily. It isn't the best program in the
world (I'm writing a full-featured DataTypes editor) but it's usable. What's
more - it has some advantages over Commodore's DTDesc (eg. you can specify
tags, tools and choose your own TypeID). As an added bonus, MakeDT comes with
source, so you can modify it to suit your needs.


                              *** 3. How to? ***

	DataTypes sub-system consists of 3 parts:
 datatypes.library is located in your LIBS: directory and is necessary to do
anything.
 files located in LIBS:DataTypes/ (they end with '.datatype') are responsible
for translating different formats. These are quite complicated programs and
require good amount of knowledge and programming skills to write.
Unfortunately, my program doesn't allow you to create them :-(yet :-).
 files located in DEVS:DataTypes/ are used to recognize type of a file. They
are stored in IFF format and will be our main area of interest. From now by
DataTypes I will mean only these files.
	Additionally, there is AddDataType command located in C: directory.
If you create or modify a DataType you should type
AddDataType <DataType name with path> REFRESH
in Shell window - otherwise new DataType will not be recognized.

                       *** 3a File type recognition ***

	There are 3 methods for detecting file's type:
 file name matching;
 file contents matching;
 custom function.
	The first method uses simple AmigaDOS pattern matching to recognize
type of a file. For example, you could enter '#?.info' to select icon files or
'.backdrop' for detecting Workbench backdrops. Any valid AmigaDOS pattern can
be used. This method is very fast (as it doesn't involve opening a file and
reading from it), but not accurate. On Amiga, files rarely have to have
special extension (in contrast to PC world, where many programs rely strictly
on names conventions). As such it should be used with some caution and only if
more advanced methods can't be used.
	The second method is more flexible. It bases on a fact that programs
usually write their own unique headers when saving data. If this is true, then
we are able to determine type of a file just by looking at its contents. For
example every GIF picture has 'GIF87a' or 'GIF89a' string at the beginning. To
utilize this method you provide up to 64 chars that should match first chars
in a file. You can also use 'match any' char. For GIF's this would look like
'GIF8?a' - the question mark matches '7' or '9'. It is advised, that you have
some documentation describing the format so you won't make false assumptions.
	Last method is the most flexible one. But... you have to be a
programmer and write a program (in C or Assembler). This program will then
look at file to check if it contains data proper for a given format. This
method is used for Commodore's MacPaint DataTypes. For more details look at
include files.

                           *** 3b Identification ***

	Each DataType is identified by 4 strings:
 <name> is a descriptive name of a DataType. It appears in MultiView after
selecting About. This name may be of arbitrary length and may contain spaces.
 <base name> indicates which .datatype library should be used to interpret
file's contents. ".datatype" is appended to <base name> and such string is
used by DataTypes to open a library. For your own DataTypes (which don't
usually come with an interpreter) you should perhaps use "binary", "exe" (for
executables) or "cli". [Note: binary.datatype, exe.datatype and cli.datatype
are 3rd party DataTypes available eg. on Aminet://util/dtype.]
 <group id> identifies a group that the file belongs to. Currently defined
groups are:
	 syst (System) - system files;
	 text (Text) - textual files;
	 docu (Document) - documents (spreadsheet data, text with pictures etc.);
	 soun (Sound) - sound samples;
	 inst (Instrument) - musical instruments;
	 musi (Music) - songs;
	 pict (Picture) - graphics;
	 anim (Animation) - animations;
	 movi (Movie) - animation with sound.

 <type id> is up to 4 chars long and (as <group id>) case sensitive. It must
also be unique and should be lower-cased.

                          *** 3c Other features ***

	Each DataType may have some tags stored. But don't ask me what they
are used for...
	Additionally, DataType can contain tool description for use with OLE
(or at least I think so). Unfortunately, no programs seems to take advantage
of this, so I was unable to test this feature. However it's there...


                               *** 4. Usage ***

	MakeDT works in batch mode. You prepare description file and give it
as a parameter. MakeDT will process it and create DataType description.
	Description file is an ASCII file. Each line begins with a command
word and it's parameters after '=' sign. Lines beginning with a '#' 
('hash') are skipped.
	Commands and parameters enclosed in [] can be omitted.
	Available commands (case is not important):

[FileName]=<Where description should be placed>
	Specifies name of DataType recog file (overridden by a CLI parameter).

DTName=<name>,<basename>
	<name> is the name of the DataType, as described in chapter 3b. For
conformance to Commodore's DTDesc, it should be the same as file part of
<FileName>.
	<basename> is equivalent to <base name> described in chapter 3b.

[Version]=<version>.<revision>
	<version> is a major version number of the DataType.
	<revision> is a minor version number of the DataType.

ID=<group id>,<type id>
	As described in chapter 3b.

Recog=<file name pattern>[,<contents pattern>]
	Recognition patterns, as described in chapter 3a. <file name pattern>
is an AmigaDOS pattern to match file name ('#?' for 'match any'). <contents
pattern> is a pattern to match file's contents. <contents pattern> may
contain:
	 strings (eg. 'FORM'), one letter for one byte of a file#
	 hexadecimal values (one for each byte), preceded by '\$' 
chars(eg. \$00\$00 for two NUL characters);
	 'match any' chars (one for each byte) in '\?' form;
	 to include '\' char enter '\\'.
	<contents pattern> is optional.
	As an example, GIF file (see chapter 3a) could be described as follows:
Recog=#?.gif                    # Only files with #?.gif extension are matched
Recog=#?,GIF8\?a                # Any name is matched and the file must begin
                                # with 'GIF8' string
Recog=#?,\$47\$49\$46\$38\?\$61 # As above, but using hexadecimal encoding

Flags=<type=Binary|ASCII|IFF|Other>,<case=y|n>,<priority>
	Flags for the DataType. <type> is general type of a file. <case>
specifies whether file-contents matching should be case-sensitive ('y') or
case-insensitive ('n'). For binary files this should be 'y', for ASCII files
- depending on file type. <priority> describes the order in which DataTypes
are checked when trying to recognize file type. <priority> must be in 0-65535
range. DataTypes with higher priority are checked first. Typical priority is
0.

[Code]=<name of file containing recog function>
	If you use custom function for recognition (see chapter 3a), enter
name of the executable file here. Otherwise don't include this tag.

[Tool]=<type=INFO|BROWSE|MAIL|EDIT|PRINT>,<name>,<start=CLI|WORKBENCH|AREXX>
[Tool]=
...
[Tool]=
	Each <Tool> describes DataType's tool (as described in chapter 3c).
<type> is type of the tool, <name> is the name of the tool <start> specifies
how the tool should be started.

[Tag]=<tag>,<tag value>
[Tag]=
...
[Tag]=
	Each <Tag> describes one DataType tag (chapter 3c). <tag> is a decimal
or hexadecimal (if preceded by '$') number describing tag. <tag value>
contains value for the tag and may also be either decimal or hexadecimal.

	As a minimum, you must provide DTName, ID, Recog and Flags commands.


                            *** 5. Other Files***

	In Example directory you will find several example descriptions.
	CatIFF.rexx lets you join several description files into one for
faster load and to save disk space. Joined files are processed correctly by
Commodore's DataTypes system.
